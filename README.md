# Mathematical-Physics-Semester-4--python
This repository includes the programs I did in semester 4 of my physics honors degree. All the codes are in python and have heavy usage of numpy, matplotlib, pandas. The problems vary from solving boundary valued differential equations, fitting curves onto experimental data, numerical integration and partial differential equations.
